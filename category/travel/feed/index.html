<p>Arriving in Switzerland by plane is the easiest and most convenient way to begin your adventures in this picturesque country.</p>



<p>If you plan on following this exact itinerary, then your best bet is to fly into Zurich International Airport and begin your trip around Switzerland from here.</p>



<p>I have put together this 8 Day Switzerland Itinerary based on my trip around the country by train using the all-in-one&nbsp;<a href="https://affiliate.klook.com/jump/activity/11366-swiss-travel-rail-pass/?krt=s20&amp;krid=16aa45f9-2097-4a76-4e5e-91a7e6f88a87&amp;adid=67925&amp;af_wid=6294" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Swiss Travel Pass</strong></a>&nbsp;which includes the majority of trains, buses, and boats throughout the whole of Switzerland.</p>



<p>Once you have purchased the<strong><a href="https://affiliate.klook.com/jump/activity/11366-swiss-travel-rail-pass/?krt=s20&amp;krid=16aa45f9-2097-4a76-4e5e-91a7e6f88a87&amp;adid=67925&amp;af_wid=6294b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;Swiss Travel Pass</a>,</strong>&nbsp;you’ll receive an email with your tickets that you will have to print and keep with you at all times.</p>



<p>I also recommend downloading the&nbsp;<strong>SBB Mobile</strong>&nbsp;app from the App Store. You can use this app to check all train, bus, and boat timetables in Switzerland when you’re on the move.</p>

<p>Traveling is not a new concept for people though the present era makes it easier than before. People do travel from different perspectives sometimes to revive themselves or to explore something new and when as a Bangladeshi you desire to go somewhere near nature, you most probably remember Cox’s Bazar as your journey destination.</p>



<p>Obviously, Cox’s Bazar is one of the best places for a tourist, and you can go any time of the year. In fact, in the monsoon also one can go to Cox&#8217;s Bazar sea beach to explore and enjoy a different environment. But before packing your backpack, you have to know some points and issues regarding traveling to Cox’s Bazar on rainy days.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="750" src="https://root-saikat.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/cox-s-bazaar-syed-zakir-hossain-1584366863439.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-359"/></figure>



<p>Cox’s Bazar is the longest sea beach in the world with 120 km in length. Therefore, not only for Bangladeshi but also for world tourists it is a destination. Though the best and first attraction of the sea beach is its length, it has various other sides to attract people to itself. For instance, the serene beauty of rows of coconut trees on the shore of Cox’s Bazar.</p>
