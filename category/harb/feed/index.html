<p>There are a lot of types of bongs out there! Fancy Bongs, Glass Bongs, expensive, Bongs, Cheap Bongs. Find out which Bong is best for you!</p>



<p>n this Guide to Different Types of Bongs, we will go over the different types of Bongs that are popular today.  There are a multitude of different bong types, styles, materials,, and designs, from Small Glass Bongs and Large Beaker Glass Bongs, to Acrylic and Metal Bongs.</p>



<h2>What Defines a “Bong”?</h2>



<p><br>As most of you may know, a bong is a water-filtered smoking device for smoking dry herbs or concentrates. Also known as a water pipe, the word bong is originally derived from the Thai word “bang” which is a long cylinder or tube, usually made from bamboo, and also used for smoking herbs.</p>



<h2>Why is Smoke Using a Bong?</h2>



<p>So why use a bong for smoking herbs?&nbsp; When smoking herbs, a flame is used to combust the herbs in the bowl, and the smoke is pulled into the lungs. With a normal dry pipe, the smoke is hot and contains almost all the carbons and plant resins, which could potentially irritate the smoker’s lungs or throat with repeated use.&nbsp; The bong offers added water filtration to the mix. The downstream of the bong goes under the water and as the herb is burned the smoke passes through the water which not only cools the smoke but also filters out some of the stickier resins and heavier carbons, which will remain in the water to be cleaned out later.&nbsp; This process results in a smoother, cooler smoking experience for the bong smoker.</p>



<h2>Best Type of Bong Materials</h2>



<p>Bongs can be made from a variety of different materials, the most common of which are Glass, Metal, Ceramic, Silicone,, and Acrylic. Glass bongs are generally the most popular, and for good reason!  </p>



<h3>Metal Bongs</h3>



<p>Metal bongs are normally used for a quicker sneak a toke style piece, such as the popular thermos bong, which looks like a thermos until it is unpacked and a bowl inserted in the side. They usually feature a matching metal bowl, which is not the best option for repeated use. Also due to the porous nature of the brushed metal, it will be hard to get fully clean after heavy use.</p>



<h3>Ceramic Bongs</h3>



<p>Ceramic bongs are the original art bongs, before the glass scene took off, people would make ceramic shapes, like skulls, wizards, or crazy art shapes, out of ceramic clay, which is then fired and glazed. These offer a better smoking experience than Metal bongs, but won’t last as long as a good glass bong.&nbsp; Ceramic bongs generally feature a metal bowl as well, which is not the best for flavor or health.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Silicone Bongs</h3>



<p>Silicone bongs are made out of polysiloxane rubber, which is temperature resistant and difficult to break, but generally made in china, and can contain unsafe materials for repeated smoking. With time and repeated cleaning, the material can also become more porous, and start to trap resins, carbon, and potentially mold, making it very difficult to get fully clean.</p>



<h3>Acrylic Bongs</h3>



<p>Acrylic is the worst type of bong, being made out of acrylic plastic, it is not very good for flavor, can’t be cleaned fully, is not very heat resistant, and isn’t healthy to smoke out of.&nbsp; The only real benefit is the low cost.&nbsp; We would advise avoiding these bongs.&nbsp; Even a seashell off the beach will give you a better smoking experience.</p>



<h3>Glass Bongs</h3>



<p>This brings us to the best type of bong, the glass bong.  Glass bongs are generally made from  one of two types of glass, Borosilicate Glass or Hard Glass, and Soft Glass or Soda Lime Glass.</p>
