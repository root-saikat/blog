<p>Traveling is not a new concept for people though the present era makes it easier than before. People do travel from different perspectives sometimes to revive themselves or to explore something new and when as a Bangladeshi you desire to go somewhere near nature, you most probably remember Cox’s Bazar as your journey destination.</p>



<p>Obviously, Cox’s Bazar is one of the best places for a tourist, and you can go any time of the year. In fact, in the monsoon also one can go to Cox&#8217;s Bazar sea beach to explore and enjoy a different environment. But before packing your backpack, you have to know some points and issues regarding traveling to Cox’s Bazar on rainy days.</p>

<p>Cox’s Bazar is the longest sea beach in the world with 120 km in length. Therefore, not only for Bangladeshi but also for world tourists it is a destination. Though the best and first attraction of the sea beach is its length, it has various other sides to attract people to itself. For instance, the serene beauty of rows of coconut trees on the shore of Cox’s Bazar.</p>
